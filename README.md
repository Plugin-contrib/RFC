## How to submit a RFC

### Request to create a plugin/extension
If you want us to make a plugin for a particular project which you feel should make other's life easier too, Great! you can submit a proposal for creation. And based on the developers our team has and if someone from our team got experience/idea to create plugins/extension for the same tool or library, we will try to create it for the community. 

**How to submit proposal ?**
You need to submit a issue here explaining your requirements and other details

**Issue title**
```
[Proposal<Library-it-used-for>]: Create-<Name/idea-of-your-plugin>
```

**Issue Body**

Then in the body explain these points clearly

- Library it will be used in
- The idea or functionality of the plugin/extension
- Problem its solving
- Is there anything similar already exists ?
- Are you willing to help in this ?
- Any other details


### Transfer
If you have any plugins or extension to share and want to maintain that together to get help from wider community !, you are in the right place.
Now to add a plugin in this organisation, You need to submit a proposal here as an issue with 

**title as following**

```
[Proposal<Library-it-used-for>]: Transfer-<Name-of-your-plugin> 
```

**The issue body must give the following details**

* Repo Link
* If published, then npm link
* Library or tools where it is being used
* What it does! ( explain in details )
* Maintainer(s)
* Are you willing to maintain it here or want us to maintain it !
* Other details you want to give

Then our team will review your proposal and will decide if it has to be here or not !


### Note:

It can be possible that we may not have developers with having experience in creating plugins for the same library or tools.
So in that case, we may hang your issue (after notifying you) for sometime and wait for someone from the community to help in.
or we may close it as a temporary basis in order to make it in future if we find someone.

### Ownership of the plugin and extension
If your proposal is getting accepted, you can take the ownership too along with us. As it will be open source and public, its really not a big issue with the ownership. 
We will place your name in the readme of that plugin as a `maintainer` or `originally proposed by`

**If your proposal is not accepted then**, we wont take any ownership and any type of credit for it! you can create and publish or your own regardless of any
